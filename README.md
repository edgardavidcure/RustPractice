# Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a RESTful API for managing Todo items using Rust, Actix Web, and MongoDB. The purpose of this software is to deepen my understanding of Rust, particularly in building web services and interacting with databases.

The software allows users to create, read, update, and delete Todo items. Each Todo item includes a unique identifier, title, description, completion status, and timestamps for creation and last update. This project showcases the power of Rust in building efficient and safe web applications.
